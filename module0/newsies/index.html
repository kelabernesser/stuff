        <p class = "stuff">Former President Barack Obama said Monday that he believes living standards and economic outcomes would improve if women led every country in the world, per the BBC.</p>
        <p class = "stuff">Speaking at a private leadership event in Singapore, Obama said he currently does not plan on getting back into political leadership because he believes in leaders stepping aside. "If you look at the world and look at the problems it's usually old people — usually old men — not getting out of the way," he said.</p>
